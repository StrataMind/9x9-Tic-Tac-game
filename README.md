## üéØ Objective

To win the main 3x3 board by winning any three mini-games in a row, column, or diagonal‚Äîsimilar to traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, but at a macro level.

## üß© Board Structure

- The game consists of a main 3x3 grid (the **main board**).
- Each cell in the main board contains its own inner 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid (a **mini-board**).
- There are 9 mini-boards in total.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Players

- 2 players: Player X and Player O.
- Players take turns alternately. Player X starts.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1.  **Initial Move:**
    *   The first player (Player X) can choose to play in any cell of any mini-board.

2.  **Move Restriction Rule:**
    *   From the second move onward, the allowed mini-board(s) for the next player are determined by the position of the **mini-board** just played in.
    *   **Rule Logic:** If the last move was made in mini-board at `(row=r, col=c)`, then the valid next mini-boards are all mini-boards in row `r` AND all mini-boards in column `c`.
        *   *Example:* If Player X plays in the top-center mini-board (t2), Player O must play in any of the mini-boards in the top row (t1, t2, t3) OR the center column (t2, m2, b2). Allowed: t1, t2, t3, m2, b2.
        *   *Center Exception:* If a player plays in the center mini-board (m2), the next player can play in *any* available mini-board.

3.  **Mini-Board Win:**
    *   A mini-board is won if a player places three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal within that mini-board.
    *   A line is drawn over the winning combination.
    *   Once a mini-board is won, its win status is fixed. No further lines are drawn even if other winning combinations are formed later.

4.  **Playable Cells in a Won Mini-Board:**
    *   If a player wins a mini-board but there are still empty cells remaining in it, the opponent (and the winner) can still play in those empty cells if directed there by the move restriction rule. The mini-board just doesn't get "locked" but its "won" status remains.

5.  **Fallback Rule for Full/Won Zones (Row-Priority Fallback):**
    *   If all valid mini-boards (based on the standard move restriction) are completely filled (regardless of win status), the next move follows this priority for choosing an available (not full) mini-board:
        1.  Top Row (t1‚Äìt3)
        2.  Middle Row (m1‚Äìm3)
        3.  Bottom Row (b1‚Äìb3)

6.  **Game Victory:**
    *   A player wins the full game if they win 3 mini-boards in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) on the main board.

7.  **Draw Condition:**
    *   If all mini-boards are filled and no player has won the main board, the game results in a draw.
