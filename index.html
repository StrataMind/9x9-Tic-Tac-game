      <h2>9x9 Tic-Tac Game Rules</h2>
      <h3>üéØ Objective</h3>
      <p>Win the main 3x3 board by winning three mini-games in a row, column, or diagonal.</p>

      <h3>üß© Board Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The game has a main 3x3 grid (<strong>main board</strong>).</li>
        <li>Each cell in the main board is a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid (a <strong>mini-board</strong>).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>üïπÔ∏è How to Play</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Initial Move:</strong> Player X starts and can play in any cell of any mini-board.</li>
        <li><strong>Move Restriction:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>After the first move, the mini-board for the next player is determined by the <strong>position of the mini-board</strong> just played in.</li>
                <li>If the last move was in mini-board at <code>(row=r, col=c)</code>, the next player must play in a mini-board in row <code>r</code> OR column <code>c</code>.</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> Play in top-center (t2) means next play is in t1, t2, t3, m2, or b2.</li>
                <li><em>Center Exception:</em> Playing in the center mini-board (m2) allows the next player to play in any available mini-board.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mini-Board Win:</strong> Get three of your symbols (X or O) in a line within a mini-board. A line will be drawn. This win is permanent for that mini-board.</li>
        <li><strong>Playable Won Boards:</strong> If a won mini-board isn't full, players can still be sent there and play in its empty cells.</li>
        <li><strong>Fallback Rule:</strong> If all normally targeted mini-boards are full, play follows this priority for available (not full) mini-boards: Top Row &gt; Middle Row &gt; Bottom Row.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Victory:</strong> Win 3 mini-boards in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) on the main board.</li>
        <li><strong>Draw:</strong> If all mini-boards are filled and no one has won the main board, it's a draw.</li>
      </ol>
